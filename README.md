Undead creatures are attacking the city! Position your units to protect the city until you have killed enough of the creatures to drive them off.

In this “tower defence” strategy game, monsters are advancing on the city from right to left across 5 lanes. To kill the monsters, you have to purchase units and place them on the field of battle so that they can shoot or block the monsters. However, you start with 10 gold and only get 1 gold per turn, so spend your precious resources wisely!

There are two types of monsters:
1. Zombies (ZOMBI) start with 15 hit points, deal 3-6 damage and move 1 square each turn. They initially give 2 gold as a reward when killed.
2. Werewolves (WWOLF) start with 10 hit points, deal 1-4 damage and move 2 squares each turn. They initially give 3 gold as a reward when killed.
