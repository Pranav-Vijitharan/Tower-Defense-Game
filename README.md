Undead creatures are attacking the city! Position your units to protect the city until you have killed enough of the creatures to drive them off.

In this “tower defence” strategy game, monsters are advancing on the city from right to left across 5 lanes. To kill the monsters, you have to purchase units and place them on the field of battle so that they can shoot or block the monsters. However, you start with 10 gold and only get 1 gold per turn, so spend your precious resources wisely!

There are 3 types of monsters:
1. Zombies (ZOMBI) start with 15 hit points, deal 3-6 damage and move 1 square each turn. They initially give 2 gold as a reward when killed.
2. Werewolves (WWOLF) start with 10 hit points, deal 1-4 damage and move 2 squares each turn. They initially give 3 gold as a reward when killed.
3. Skeleton (SKELE) starts with 10 hit points, deals 1-3 damage, but it only takes half damage from Archers.

Players can purchase 3 types of “defender” units:
1. Archers (ARCHR) start with 5 hit points. Each turn, they will shoot an arrow down their lane from left to right, dealing 1-4 damage to the first monster it hits. They    cost 5 gold to purchase.
2. Walls (WALL) start with 20 hit points. They do not deal any damage and serve to block and slow down the monsters. They cost 3 gold to purchase.
3. Cannon (CANON) start with 8 hit points. It deals 3-5 damage, but can only fire every other turn. It also has a 50% chance to push a monster backwards by one square.      They cost 7 gold to purchase
